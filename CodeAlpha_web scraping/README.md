Web Scraping & Dataset Creation Project
This project demonstrates the ability to extract, clean, and structure data from the web using both programmatic (Python) and automated (No-Code) methods.

🎯 Objectives
Extract Data: Use Python to navigate HTML structures.

Custom Dataset: Create a structured CSV from unstructured web pages.

Tool Comparison: Compare BeautifulSoup with automated tools like Octoparse.

🛠️ Methods Used
1. Python (BeautifulSoup)
I used the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML and requests to handle web navigation.

Identify: Located specific CSS classes like .product_pod and .price_color.

Collection: Extracted titles, prices, and stock status.

Storage: Exported the final data into a structured .csv file for analysis.

2. Automated Tools (Octoparse / ParseHub)
For complex websites with JavaScript or pagination that require no-code solutions:

Workflow: Point-and-click to select data fields.

Benefit: Handles "infinite scroll" and "IP rotation" more easily than basic scripts.

Result: Generated a similar dataset without writing a single line of code.
